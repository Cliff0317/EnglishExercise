# English Exercise
This is the English exercise I made using HTML, CSS and JS. In the listening test, the admin inputs some text for the system to read on the top to the page and clicks on the button below in order to read it. In the speaking test, the user clicks on the "start speaking" button and the user's words are recorded until the user presses the "end speaking" button to end the speaking exercise.
